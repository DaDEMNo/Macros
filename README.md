MOBILE INSTRUCTIONS


These are my macros that come from my tablet.
You need to download Geode from geode-sdk.org
then downloads then if you see an update thing
and that geode cant be downloaded
then just scroll until you find the GitHub thing
for older versions you can pick any
version you want, it depends on your game version
on what you need to download I think. You can also
google it (Geode for 2.111, Geode for 2.207, etc)
Then once your done downloading Geode you can get
xdbot or maybe any bot (i use xdbot) and when your
done with allat you just make a macro of a level
first. (doesn't matter if its another level it just
matters if you created a macro or not.)
When your done making a macro, check Android/media/com.geode.launcher/game/macros
if theres any macros. It should be something like
Stereo Madness.gdr or anything. Now you can download
the .gdr file(s) and put it in the macros folder!
